# Github Repository Search Application

This is a sample application that performs a repo search for github repositories.  It is using Sencha Touch Technologies and the Github repo api to find repos about certain technologies.

## How to use on the iPad

    Open Safari on the ipad and navigate 
    
    [http://github-repo-search.heroku.com](http://github-repo-search.heroku.com)
    
    Then click on the '+' sign on the nav bar
    and select add to home page, this will create
    a simple icon to access the app.

## Why

We love reading source code, and a great device to read it on is the iPad, it would be nice to have an HTML 5 application that works on the ipad to search and browse the github repositories to easily locate repositories of interest.
