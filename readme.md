# Github Repository Search Application

This is a sample application that performs a repo search for github repositories.  It is using Sencha Touch Technologies and the Github repo api to find repos about certain technologies.

## Why

We love reading source code, and a great device to read it on is the iPad, it would be nice to have an HTML 5 application that works on the ipad to search and browse the github repositories to easily locate repositories of interest.
